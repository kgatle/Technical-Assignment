1. implement a function closestToZero to return the value closest to zero
which is supplied via the input array $arrayValues
- if $arrayValues is empty return 0
- if two numbers are equally close to zero, consider the positive number
to be closer to zero
-


<?php
function closestToZero($arrayValues=array())
{

}


/* test code */
$input = array(7,-10,13,8,4,-7.2,-12,-3.7,3.5,-9.6,6.5,-1.7,-6.2,7);
echo "Result " . closestToZero($input);
?>



- Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a given
list using a for-loop, a while-loop, and recursion.

- Write a function that combines two lists by alternatively taking
elements. For
example: given the two lists [a, b, c] and [1, 2, 3], the function should
return [a, 1, b, 2, c, 3].

- Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci
numbers. By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. As
an example, here are the first 10 Fibonnaci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,
13, 21, and 34.

-  Given array of integers, find the lowest absolute sum of elements.

- Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing
between the numbers 1, 2, ..., 9 (in this order) such that the result is
always 100. For example: 1 + 2 + 34  5 + 67  8 + 9 = 100.
